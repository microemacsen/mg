PORTING MG AND USING LIBBSD

I've maintained and ported mg for quite some time now and at first it
was easy recently it got harder and harder since it was a moving
target. Especially the inclusion of some system specific libraries since
about 2 years ago made it to much of an effort for my humble coding
skills.

So recently Jasper Lievisse Adriaanse asked me to try it again and I
restarted working on the project and ran into exactly the same problems
again. While googling for solutions I ran into libbsd:

  http://libbsd.freedesktop.org/wiki/

It's a porting library for OpenBSD code! And after installing that it
was a piece of pie to get mg ported again.

PORTING TO ALL OTHER PLATFORMS

Okay, that was debian. Now I have to get the rest of all the previously
suported platforms working again. All help is welcome and as always:
Please provide patches that do not break stuff for other platforms.

BUILDING MG

So, basic instructions for building mg:

 - Get libbsd installed.
 - run the following commands:

   make
   sudo make install

USING CVS

This code is the cvs checkout from the OpenBSD project so if you install
cvs you can see what I changed to port mg. Like this:

   cvs diff -uw
